Steps for executing a Query in Hive and Impala
Hive receives a SQL query and performs the following steps to get the result:

1.Parses HiveQL
2.Makes optimizations
3.Plans for execution
4.Submits job to the cluster
5.Monitors the progress
6.Processes the data: The job is sent to the data processing engine where it is either converted to MapReduce or processed by Spark.
7.Stores the data in HDFS

Letâ€™s now discuss Impala

Impala performs the following steps after receiving a SQL query:

1.Parses Impala SQL
2.Makes optimizations
3.Plans for execution
4.Executes a query on the cluster
5.Stores data in a cluster
